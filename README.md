[Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

I've done each puzzle in a seperate jupyter notebook using python 3. Some notes:

Days 1-21 are all done so far. Annoying a jupyter bug wiped clean my day 21 notebook when I closed it, before I commited it to git.
